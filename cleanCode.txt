chapte 2 -- Naming 


We should use good names. name should be appealing, they should reveal the cause of their creation.
int noOfDays;
double amountInAccount;
Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s actually a List .
The word list means something specific to programmers. If the container holding the
accounts is not actually a List , it may lead to false conclusions. 1 So accountGroup or
bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better.

Sometimes we create problems for ourself as  compiler dont let us use same name for two variable hence we try to miss-spell one. Like klass for class.

Number-series naming (a1, a2, .. aN) is the opposite of intentional naming. Such
names are not disinformative—they are noninformative; they provide no clue to the
author’s intention. Consider:
public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
a2[i] = a1[i];
}
}
